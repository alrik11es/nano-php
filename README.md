# nanoPHP

minimalistic couchdb driver for PHP >5.3 it's intended to be exactly the same as
https://github.com/dscape/nano but in PHP

`nano` features:

* **minimalistic** - there is only a minimum of abstraction between you and 
  couchdb
* **pipes** - proxy requests from couchdb directly to your end user
* **errors** - errors are proxied directly from couchdb: if you know couchdb 
  you already know `nano`


# THIS DRIVER IS IN DEVELOPMENT NOT STABLE
